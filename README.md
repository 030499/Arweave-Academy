## Overview
The School of DumDum is a part of Arweave Academy developer education program. We offer developers free, high-quality courses and practical tasks to help them start building applications on Arweave and AO from scratch.  

Special thanks to [@K4y1s](https://x.com/K4y1s), [@sayestheorem](https://x.com/sayestheorem), [@rosmcmahon_real](https://x.com/rosmcmahon_real) and [@developer_dao](https://x.com/developer_dao) for support, and to [@OpenBuildxyz](https://x.com/OpenBuildxyz) for their guidance and assistance with the event process.

We divided this event into two parts: one for beginners and one for advanced developers.
- **Beginners** can enter the Learning section, where they will complete their learning by studying courses and submitting tasks.
- **Advanced Developers**, they can directly participate in the Practice section, which is a competition. You can choose a topic of your interest from the challange list and complete the practice by developing and writing tutorials. The best practices will be selected by judges and rewarded. 

The specific process is shown in the diagram below:

## Task Submission
After each course, there will be a series of tasks. These tasks are the primary way to assess whether you have mastered the course content. 

For example, to submit `task1`, follow these steps:

1. Create a `task1` folder under `submissions/YourName`.
2. Copy the [task1.md](./task/task1.md) file into your `task1` folder. You can also create a `readme.md` file to organize your task content. (Submission of learning notes and reflections is encouraged.)
3. Answer all the questions in the tasks and fill in the answers in the table at the top of the file.
4. Submit a `PR` (Pull Request) to this repository. Once the `PR` is merged, `task1` will be considered complete.
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Each **Task** must be submitted separately. A single `PR` containing multiple **Tasks** will be closed directly.

Developers who complete all the courses and submit the tasks will receive a Level 1 Certification. If you earn all 4 Levels of Certifications in the future, you will be awarded a **Final Graduation Certificate** and become a priority candidate in our talent pool, gaining access to more job opportunities within the ecosystem.
