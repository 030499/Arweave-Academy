## Overview
This Arweave Academy is part of the developer education program's Level 1. We offer developers free, high-quality courses and practical tasks to help them start building applications on Arweave and AO from scratch.

After completing the learning program, capable developers can participate in the Best Practices Contest, with Forward Research supporting a XXXX reward for the winner.

We divided this event into two parts: one for beginners and one for advanced developers.
- Developers who are new to the Arweave and AO ecosystems can enter the Learning section, where they will complete their learning by studying courses and submitting tasks.
- For advanced developers, they can directly participate in the Practice section, which is a competition. You can choose a topic of your interest from the challange list and complete the practice by developing and writing tutorials. The best practices will be selected by judges and rewarded. 

The specific process is shown in the diagram below:
