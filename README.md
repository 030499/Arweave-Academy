## Overview

The School of DumDum is a part of Arweave Academy developer education program. We offer developers free, high-quality courses and practical tasks to help them start building applications on Arweave and AO from scratch.  

Special thanks to [@K4y1s](https://x.com/K4y1s), [@sayestheorem](https://x.com/sayestheorem), [@rosmcmahon_real](https://x.com/rosmcmahon_real) and [@developer_dao](https://x.com/developer_dao) for support, and to [@OpenBuildxyz](https://x.com/OpenBuildxyz) for their guidance and assistance with the event process.

We divided this event into two parts: one for beginners and one for advanced developers.

- **Beginners** can enter the `Learning section`, where they will complete their learning by studying courses and submitting tasks.
- **Advanced Developers** can directly participate in the `Practice section` competition. You can choose a topic of your interest from the challange list and complete the practice by developing and writing tutorials. The best practices will be selected by judges and rewarded.

## Preparation

Before participating in the event, here‚Äôs what you need to prepare:

- An Arweave/AO wallet -- [Arconnect](https://www.arconnect.io/)
- An all-in-one Arweave AO relevant documentation list -- [awesome-ao](https://github.com/ArweaveOasis/awesome-ao)
- Arweave block explorer -- [viewblock](https://viewblock.io/arweave)
- AO explorer -- [aolink](https://www.ao.link/)

## Registration

Developers need to complete GitHub registration by following these steps:

1. **Star**, **Watch** and **Fork** this repository and `git clone` it to your local machine. <br> üëâ Not familiar with Git/Github? Check out [Using Arweave Academy Github](./doc/Using%20Arweave%20Academy%20Github.md).
2. Navigate to the `submissions` folder and create a new folder named after your GitHub username, e.g. `submissions/YourName`.
3. Copy the [Template.md](./template.md) file into the newly created folder and rename it to your name: `YourName.md`.
4. Open the `submissions/YourName/YourName.md` file, fill in your information as instructed, and save it.
5. Commit your changes and create a Pull Request to this repository. Once your PR is merged, your GitHub registration is complete.
6. Once completed, you are welcome to join in the Arweave Academy [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Z7R7Az6T)!

## Task Submission

After each course there will be a series of tasks. These tasks will test whether you have mastered the course content.

For example, to submit `task1`, follow these steps:

1. Create a `task1` folder under `submissions/YourName`.
2. Copy the [task1.md](./task/task1.md) file into your `task1` folder. You can also create a `readme.md` file to organize your task content. (Submission of learning notes and reflections is encouraged.)
3. Answer all the questions in the tasks and fill in the answers in the table at the top of the file.
4. Submit a Pull Request to this repository. Once the PR is merged, `task1` will be considered complete.
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Each task must be submitted separately. A single PR containing multiple tasks will be closed.

Developers who complete all the courses and submit the tasks will receive a Level 1 Certification. If you earn all 4 Levels of Certifications in the future, you will be awarded a **Final Graduation Certificate** and become a priority candidate in our talent pool, gaining access to more job opportunities within the ecosystem.
